The Middle Oconee is a beautiful mid-sized river near Athens, Georgia. The river has been the subject of many scientific studies for a variety of reasons. Multiple communities withdraw water from the river, and it is an important location for community recreation. The watershed size and hydrology are such that the river can feasibility be studied using common scientific methods for wadeable rivers. The University of Georgia is just a few miles away, and the river has been a convenient ecological system for asking a variety of research questions. Collectively, these factors put the river in a "Sweet spot" of being complex enough from a socio-ecological lens, but manageable enough relative to the logistics of conducting river investigations. This website compiles published scientific studies and data sets collected on this unique and important river. The goal is to create a repository of knowledge developed in this system for future researchers.
